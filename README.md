# Simple Zork Game Assignment
### author: Pablo Garcia Fuentes

This is my version of the zork game that I prepared for this assignment.

##### The premise is simple, there are different rooms where you can move and pick up items from. To finish the game, the player needs to enter to the bathroom.
- You can move across the map with verbs "go" and "move" followed by the specific direction (north, south...).
- You can pick items with verbs "get" and "pick", mix them with the verbs "mix" and "put", you can also drop items with the verb "drop". All of those commands need to be followed by the name of the item you want to interact with. In case of mixing, you have to write the two items you want to mix.
- You can also interact with an NPC, Jimmy, you can talk to him ("talk"), give him items ("give"), or even kill him if you see fitting ("kill"). You need to write Jimmy after the command, and in case of giving him something, you need to write the item too.

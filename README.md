Simple Zork Game Assigment

author: Pablo Garcia Fuentes

This is my version of the zork game that i prepared for the assigment.

To play is simple, there's dirferent rooms were you can move and pick items from. To finish the game, the player needs to go to the bathroom, doing the necessary to aquire it.
You can move across the map with verbs like go or move and the specific direction(north, south...).
You can pick items with verbs like get or pick, mix them with the verbs mix or put or also drop them, all this followed by the name of the ithem you want to interact with.

You can also interact with an Npc, jimmy, you van talk to him, give him an specific item, or even kill him if he es very annoying.
